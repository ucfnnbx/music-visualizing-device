Develop a hardware prototype to visualize your music in frequency spectrum. The signal is collected with a microphone, which is processed with FFT in Arduino, and then displayed on a LED matrix. For interaction, there is a button for user to change the display modes. 
A report, a video demo and an introductory PowerPoint of this device can be found in above documents.
